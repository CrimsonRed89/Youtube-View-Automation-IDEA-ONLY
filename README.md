# Why does this Ideal project fails?

YouTube wants views to come from real people, so it likely discounts or filters out multiple views from the same IP address if they seem suspicious or bot-generated. YouTube does count your own views. However, there is a cap on how many views will be registered when you watch your own videos. You are only able to gain a maximum of 3 views on your videos. So, if you watch a video you uploaded 4 times, only 3 views will count.
